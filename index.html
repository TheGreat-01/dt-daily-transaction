NOTES ON DICTIONARIES
================================

Principal Use Cases for Dictionaries
------------------------------------

Passing keyword arguments
    Typically, one read and one write for 1 to 3 elements.
    Occurs frequently in normal python code.

Class method lookup
    Dictionaries vary in size with 8 to 16 elements being common.
    Usually written once with many lookups.
    When base classes are used, there are many failed lookups
        followed by a lookup in a base class.

Instance attribute lookup and Global variables
    Dictionaries vary in size.  4 to 10 elements are common.
    Both reads and writes are common.

Builtins
    Frequent reads.  Almost never written.
    About 150 interned strings (as of Py3.3).
    A few keys are accessed much more frequently than others.

Uniquification
    Dictionaries of any size.  Bulk of work is in creation.
    Repeated writes to a smaller set of keys.
    Single read of each key.
    Some use cases have two consecutive accesses to the same key.

    * Removing duplicates from a sequence.
        dict.fromkeys(seqn).keys()

    * Counting elements in a sequence.
        for e in seqn:
          d[e] = d.get(e,0) + 1

    * Accumulating references in a dictionary of lists:

        for pagenumber, page in enumerate(pages):
          for word in page:
            d.setdefault(word, []).append(pagenumber)

    Note, the second example is a use case characterized by a get and set
    to the same key.  There are similar use cases with a __contains__
    followed by a get, set, or del to the same key.  Part of the
    justification for d.setdefault is combining the two lookups into one.

Membership Testing
    Dictionaries of any size.  Created once and then rarely changes.
    Single write to each key.
    Many calls to __contains__() or has_key().
    Similar access patterns occur with replacement dictionaries
        such as with the % formatting operator.

Dynamic Mappings
    Characterized by deletions interspersed with adds and replacements.
    Performance benefits greatly from the re-use of dummy entries.

Data Layout
-----------

Dictionaries are composed of 3 components:
The dictobject struct itself
A dict-keys object (keys & hashes)
A values array


Tunable Dictionary Parameters
-----------------------------

See comments for PyDict_MINSIZE, USABLE_FRACTION and GROWTH_RATE in
dictobject.c

Tune-ups should be measured across a broad range of applications and
use cases.  A change to any parameter will help in some situations and
hurt in others.  The key is to find settings that help the most common
cases and do the least damage to the less common cases.  Results will
vary dramatically depending on the exact number of keys, whether the
keys are all strings, whether reads or writes dominate, the exact
hash values of the keys (some sets of values have fewer collisions than
others).  Any one test or benchmark is likely to prove misleading.

While making a dictionary more sparse reduces collisions, it impairs
iteration and key listing.  Those methods loop over every potential
entry.  Doubling the size of dictionary results in twice as many
non-overlappi
always be in a different cache line from the key.
